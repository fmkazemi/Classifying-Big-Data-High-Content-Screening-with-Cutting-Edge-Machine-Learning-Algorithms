# Deep-Learning-on-HC-Bigdata
HCS technologies have become powerful systems for studying biology. 

In this work, we are interested in the application and provision of cutting-edge machine learning algorithms for HC data analysis, which are tailored to suit its specific conditions and challenges. This work focuses on the challenge of using information content that is as high as possible, by considering all the available features, to build a system for HC analysis. 

-	Designed and implemented novel Deep Learning algorithms (Supervised and Unsupervised methods) for HCS Big Data analysis with 100% accuracy for predicting 10 phenomena out of 12 phenomena in biology using Python, TensorFlow, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Keras, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Linux, shell scripting, and Git.

-	Conducted data preparation and visualization, Anomaly detection.

-	Worked on Compute Canada GPU and HPC clusters. Supported by ACENET, Calcul Qu√©bec, WestGrid and Compute Canada.

-	Investigated how to work appropriately with Deep Learning algorithms such as AlexNet, VGG, GoogleNet, Inception, Deep Residual Networks, DenseNet in confronting with imbalanced datasets such as fraud detection, factory products, and HCS datasets.


The final version of the code will be released after publishing papers. This work will be presented in the industry.
